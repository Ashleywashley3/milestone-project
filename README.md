This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created to play with a friend. 
First player is "X" and the second player is "O".
All you have to do is click one of the boxes to play your move. 
A message will be displayed below the board letting you know whose turn it is.
If "X" wins then a message will appear displaying, "Player X has won!" and the same for player "O" if the second player wins.
If no one wins then a message displaying, "Tie game!" will appear.
You can clear the board to start over by clicking the "Restart Game" button below the board.
